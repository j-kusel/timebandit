### Stealing Time - a conceptual introduction
For all intents and purposes, support for multiple tempi in contemporary DAWs and notation software is nonexistent. After sections are notated in conventional software, scores may be painfully cobbled together from vector file exports, but this destructive editing process makes mistakes tedious and costly to fix. Handwritten or CAD approaches can keep composers from fighting with opinionated software alignment when working with asynchronous time, but calculating rhythms by hand is a drudgery to which few would voluntarily commit. Timing compatibility between software for even as simple an example as an ensemble accelerando becomes a feat, much less dealing with tempo changes in performance between musicians or MIDI devices. What if these deterrents were removed?<br>

**Bandit** intends to provide a composition and performance toolkit for the management of time both in the abstract and concrete. Its purpose is not to replace the software suites for notation and performance with which you're already familiar, but rather to integrate into their workflow and reveal and ameliorate their deficiencies in the realm of tempo.
