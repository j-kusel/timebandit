## Bandit hardware

The Bandit board is a USB-powered, open-hardware metronome with up to eight channels for controlling the [SparkFun ROB-08449](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/SparkFun/ROB-08449?qs=WyAARYrbSnZj6jJCAHtRrQ%3D%3D) vibration motor. As hardware files are updated, two versions will be maintained to minimize cost and maximize accessibility - one making use of [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/)'s surface-mount component service (more expensive) and one which requires you to source your own components (more soldering required). As of the time of this writing, JLCPCB does not offer an SMD micro-USB port component, which can be difficult to solder; future versions may include optional headers for accessing the pins directly.

You are encouraged to print and build the boards and wearables yourself, but if any of these steps are major obstacles to actually using the software in a live capacity, just message me and we'll work something out.

This folder contains versions of the Bandit board schematic/BOM/gerber files and software updates for flashing the onboard ATMega328p, and will later include sewing patterns for vibration motor wearables. Both software and hardware patches are detailed in the version folders.
